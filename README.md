# Third Party Authentication in Flask

![Third Party Authentication](/app/static/images/flask_oauth.gif)

### Overview

The use of third party apps to assist in login is fairly common. It improves a user's experience whenever they want to access content that is protected.

### Tools Used
* Rauth 
* Flask framework
* Python 3 for programming
* SQLite database
* Flask-Bootstrap for crossplatform responsiveness
* Flask-WTF for web form creation
* Flask-Migrate for database management
* Flask-Mail to handle password reset requests
* Twitter API
* FaceBook API
* Heroku for deployment

### Features
* User authentication
* Password Reset
* Message flashing for improved user feedback
* Error handling and useful redirects
* Social Logins

### Deployed Application
* [Flask third party auth](https://flask-third-party-auth.herokuapp.com/) - Heroku
* [Flask Third Parth Auth](https://third-party-auth.onrender.com) - Render

### Contributors
* [Gitau Harrison](https://github.com/GitauHarrison)

### Testing Deployed App

* Click on either _LOGIN WITH FACEBOOK_ or _LOGIN WITH TWITTER_ buttons
* Enter your account details upon request
* You should be able to log in

### Testing Locally

You will need:

* [Facebook app account](https://developer.facebook.com/)
* [Twitter developer account](https://apps.twitter.com/)

Learn how to create a Facebook and a Twitter app in this [ third party authentication guide](https://github.com/GitauHarrison/notes/blob/master/two_factor_authentication/third_party_auth.md). From this guide you will  learn how to generate your Facebook and Twitter apps' _API Keys_ and _Secret_ID_. You will need them to run this application locally.

#### Additional Notes on Twitter Developer API

Twitter API working you need "Elevated" Access Level

Screenshot from below Page: 
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-leve

Additionally you need to add the below URL to your *Callback URI / Redirect URL* settings in Twitter developer API
```http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback/twitter```

If you have only "Essential" Twitter API Access - you will get the below error message in response.

```
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Jul/2022 03:37:32] "GET /authorize/twitter HTTP/1.1" 302 -
{'errors': [{'message': 'You currently have Essential access which includes access to Twitter API v2 endpoints only. If you need access to this endpoint, youâ€™ll need to apply for Elevated access via the Developer Portal.

To test this application, first 

1. Clone it:

```python
$ git clone git@github.com:GitauHarrison/third-party-authentication-using-flask.git
```

2. Create and activate your virtual environment:

```python
$ mkvirtualenv flask_auth_test # I am using virtualenvwrapper
```

3. Install necessary dependancies as seen in `requirements.txt`:

```python
(flask_auth_test)$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```python
(flask_auth_test)$ flask run
```

5. Before you can run your server, remember to create a `.env` file following the guidance seen in the `.env-template`. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```python
(flask_auth_test)$ touch .env
```

6. Update the `.env` file with all the necessary details. Here is a sample:

```python
TWITTER_ID=
TWITTER_SECRET=
FACEBOOK_ID=
FACEBOOK_SECRET=
```

7. Run flask server:

```python
(flask_auth_test)$ flask run
```

Once your application is running, you can access your localhost on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. I have not used `ngrok`. If you wish to do so, to provision temporary public URLs that will allow access to your application, learn how you can set it up [here](https://gitauharrison-blog.herokuapp.com/ngrok).

With the application running:

* Click on either social login buttons
* Authorize your account to sign you up
* You should be able to see the home page
